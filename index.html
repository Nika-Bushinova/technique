              The company from Cupertino was not satisfied with the sale of smartphones of the past
              generation, so in 2023 it was decided to seriously rework
              the whole line.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main innovation of the new iPhones will be bringing all
              line models to a common design code. This year even the iPhone 15
              and iPhone 15 Plus will receive an island cutout in the screen, which
              will replace everyone's boring visor.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, the new items will support Wi-Fi 7, which they need to
              better compatibility with the Vision Pro VR helmet. And here is the camera
              periscope type awaits only flagship models: iPhone 15
              Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the low popularity of the iPhone 14, reduce prices for
              Apple's new items most likely will not. Rather, the opposite is true.
              Companies are becoming increasingly difficult to resist inflation. That's why
              there is a high risk of price increases for the iPhone 15. Even hinted at this
              CEO Tim Cook, who said that people
              in general, they are ready to pay more for iPhones.
            </p>
            <p>Almost simultaneously, sources from several technology and business publications reported a problem faced
              at the factories of Foxconn, Apple's main assembler of equipment. It is reported by "The Rambler".</p>
            <p>The issue is related to the new displays for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. It is reported that
              due to the decrease in the thickness of the frame around the Pro-series screens to 1.5 mm, their
              manufacturer, LG Display, applied a new technological process and displays for the iPhone 15 Pro and
              especially for the Pro Max did not pass tests for reliability of fastening to metal smartphone case.
              Apparently, this is the same issue that Apple has experienced in the past with some Apple Watch models.
            </p>
            <p>Now Apple and LG are working on a solution. Apple also has displays made by Samsung that can be used to
              assemble the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p>
            <p>Analysts estimate the delay in the production of the Pro-series at the level of 15-17 percent from the
              same period last year. This is a significant lag, which, if not affect the date of the announcement of the
              entire line, it may affect the start of sales of Pro and Pro Max.</p>
          
          <p>Another issue Apple fans are worried about is a possible price increase for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15
            Pro Max.</p>
          <p>If this happens, it will be the first official price increase for premium iPhones. Since the introduction
            of the $999 iPhone X in 2017 and the $1,099 iPhone XS Max in 2018, the prices of the top-of-the-line Pro
            models have not changed</p>
            <p>Considering how long Apple has kept the price of the Pro series, a price increase is more than likely.</p>
