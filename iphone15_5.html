                     USB Type-C for different categories of devices has already become the standard. It is thanks to him that you can
                      take different chargers for your smartphone, tablet and laptop with you on trips, and get by
                      one and transmit data over the wire at high speeds. But the only smartphones that
                      iPhones have not yet switched to USB-C. However, this will not last long. To fulfill
                      legal requirements in Europe, Apple will have to transfer its smartphones to the new connector.</p>
                  <p>But they don’t want to put up with the loss of a huge layer of profit in Cupertino and will make USB-C in
                     The iPhone 15 is unusual, but with certain limitations. If you try to use
                     non-original or simply non-certified cable, then about fast charging and high-speed transmission
                     you can forget the data. We will tell you how it will be implemented and why Apple is again ripping us off
                     money.</p>

                  <h3>iPhone with USB-C</h3>
                  <p>
                     When Apple announced that iPhones would now ship without power supplies and justified this
                      concern for the environment, many of us have a bad suspicion that we are being deceived. And this
                      really so, because in Cupertino they always made a lot of money on accessories, and then another
                      one chance to collect money from willing iPhone users.
                  </p>
                  <p>A blow from the European Union with mandatory USB-C in all electronics, including the iPhone, has become for
                     Apple is very painful. In fact, the company was forced to take not its own technology and use it
                     her. With this approach, absolutely any wires will fit the iPhone, no matter who made them: Xiaomi,
                     Huawei, Apple itself, or Uncle Liao from the basement. And most importantly, you have to gradually start
                     opt out of the MFI Accessories Certification program for wires, which allows Apple to
                     for more than one year to collect a good income.</p>
                  <p>But Apple wouldn't be Apple if it didn't come up with a way out of the situation. If you ever
                     used a very cheap Lightning for seventy rubles, they could watch it on the iPhone screen
                     "This accessory is not supported" message. In such a situation, charging simply did not go. It is connected with
                     the fact that it did not have a special chip. Some manufacturers have figured out how to get around this.
                     limitation, and with the same wire it worked irregularly. That is, at one moment
                     the charge went fine, and the next day a notification about an unsupported accessory might appear.
                  </p>
                  <p>USB-C in the iPhone 15 will have exactly the same limitation. But this time Apple will give
                     much more attention to the compatibility of accessories. Original and MFI certified wires
                     will support fast charging and have an increased data transfer rate over the wire. And when
                     attempting to use any third party cable the user will simply encounter charging at power 5
                     Tue Yes, just like using an ancient power supply. Do you really care about speed?
                     data transmission over the wire, but charging is of great importance. In such a situation, the desire to receive
                     fast charging will just make you pay more. Don't you think it smacks of frank
                     divorce? You pay full price for the smartphone and its features, among which there is a fast
                     charging, but you can only use it with original wires.</p>
                  <p>And now imagine that the cost of original and MFI wires after switching to USB-C will remain
                     about the same level. What choice will you make? If you can count money, you won't
                     overpay for certification, which essentially gives you nothing and just buy a quality
                     accessory from a well-known manufacturer. And so that you and I don’t have such a choice, Apple wants to
                     make a similar restriction. Yes, the price difference between MFI wire and regular wire is not that big, but
                     nevertheless, it exists. And if, in general, the wires have no differences, then why pay more?</p>
                  <p>In this situation, it remains only to take care of the complete cable so that it is not lost anywhere.
                     or not spoiled. But I won’t be surprised if, following the introduction of USB-C, Apple refuses at all
                     from the wire supplied. So what. Wanted a popular connector? Here, get it. And we are further
                     Let's fight for the environment. That's just for the sake of fast charging will have to fork out for
                     corresponding wire. Once again, it seems to me that someone has forgotten that he makes his technique for
                     people, not hamsters, who will eat everything they are offered.</p>
