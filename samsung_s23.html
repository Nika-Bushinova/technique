                  <h3>Look and feel</h3>
                  <p>Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra comes in a miniature box with only one connecting cable in
                     kit. Charger, protective case and all other accessories will have to be purchased in addition
                     optional.</p>
                  <p>Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra lies perfectly in the hand, this is the first sensation that is realized
                     when
                     familiarity with the novelty. Not all Korean smartphones were so practical: there were also too
                     narrow
                     edges, and heavily curved glass - and here all this is present to some extent. Smartphone not
                     received
                     fashionable flat surfaces and wide sidewalls, the body is streamlined in the old fashioned way.
                     However, he was given
                     such a shape and picked up such materials that the case does not scroll in the palm of your hand
                     and does not strive
                     sneak away. Even despite the maximum dimensions and large mass.</p>
                  <p>The case still has bends on the sides. The screen is protected by the latest Corning Gorilla Glass.
                     Victus 2. Matte back in the same material. Side frame - from "reinforced"
                     aluminum. On the sides, the frame is slightly rounded, but not as much narrowed as before. the top
                     one and
                     the bottom ends are completely flat. A smartphone, if desired, can be put on the table, although
                     this is still
                     it will not be a very stable position.</p>
                  <img src="img/samsung23_3.jpg" alt="Samsung S23 Ultra" class="vision">
                  <p>The cameras on the back are minimalist - just separate protruding lenses.
                     Unusual creeping on the side face uniting them block-"blotch" from past seasons
                     completely disappeared in the new series.

                  <h3>
                     Screen
                  </h3>
                  <p>The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is equipped with a 6.8" AMOLED (Dynamic AMOLED 2X) display
                     inches and a resolution of 1440 × 3088, covered with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2. Physical dimensions
                     screens are 73 × 157 mm, the aspect ratio is 20:9, the dot density is 500 ppi. Frame width
                     around the screen is 2 mm from the sides, 2.5 mm from the top and 3 mm from the bottom. For screen supported
                     120Hz refresh rate and HDR10+.</p>
                  <p>The front surface of the screen is made in the form of a glass plate with a mirror-smooth surface,
                     scratch resistant. Judging by the reflection of objects, the anti-glare properties of the screen are better than
                     at the screen of Google Nexus 7 (2013) (hereinafter simply Nexus 7). To illustrate, here is a photograph
                     which in the off screens reflects a white surface (left - Nexus 7, right - Samsung
                     Galaxy S23 Ultra, further they can be distinguished by size):</p>
                  <h3>Camera</h3>
                  <p>
                  <ul>The smartphone is equipped with a main camera with a sensor as much as 200 megapixels, as well as two telephoto lenses,
                     realizing an optical zoom, and an ultra-wide-angle module.

                     <li>200MP, 1/1.3″, 0.6µm, f/1.7, 24mm, multi-directional PDAF, Laser AF, OIS (primary)</li>
                     <li> 10MP, 1/3.52″, 1.12µm, f/2.4, 70mm, Dual Pixel PDAF, OIS, 3× optical zoom (telephoto)
                     </li>
                     <li> 10MP, 1/3.52″, 1.12µm, f/4.9, 230mm, Dual Pixel PDAF, OIS, 10x optical zoom (periscope)
                     </li>
                     <li>12MP, 1/2.55″, 1.4µm, f/2.2, 13mm, 120°, Dual Pixel PDAF, Super Steady video
                        (wide angle)</li>
                     </p>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The main camera with a rare 200-megapixel Samsung sensor has three shooting modes:
                     50MP pixel binning (4 in 1), 12MP pixel binning (16 in 1) and full resolution
                     200 MP. There is a fast phase detection autofocus with a laser assistant and an optical stabilizer.</p>

                  <p>It seems that 200 megapixels is cool. But in reality, such pictures look noticeably worse than processed ones.
                     12 megapixels. Yes, theoretically there is some gain in detail, but it is very hard to see it.
                     not easy: 200-megapixel picture is filled with artifacts from noise suppression, monochrome
                     areas are “smoothed” to zero, contrasting borders are underlined. In general, looking at this is not very
                     Nice. 50-megapixel photos have soft processing that blurs the remaining sharp edges,
                     so the image looks soapy. And at the final stage of reduction, the processing algorithms again
                     are passed through the picture by sharpening, so that at 12 megapixels we get a proprietary image of Samsung: sharply
                     (sometimes - deliberately sharply) and neatly. Looks nice, but in the photos of a higher
                     resolution makes little sense.</p>
                  <p>The smartphone can shoot video in 8K at 30 frames per second, but the picture is slightly strobe, which
                     clearly noticeable in dynamic scenes, and besides, there is no stabilization. But when shooting at 2560 × 1440 at 60
                     frames per second, the image is no less clear and detailed, but much more
                     smooth. When moving to 1080p, the picture becomes loose, but the stabilizer works perfectly.
                     The color rendition, of course, is oversaturated, but the video sequence looks spectacular. Video Quality
                     also very high.</p>
                  <p>Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is both a stylish expensive fashion solution and technically
                     a perfect multimedia combine that can satisfy all the needs of the user at work,
                     recreation and creativity. The only relative disadvantage against the background of modern Chinese flagships
                     can be considered not the fastest charging, but given the huge number of advantages of this model,
                     such a "flaw" causes happy owners, rather, a condescending smile.</p>
