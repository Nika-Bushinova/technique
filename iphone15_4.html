                     For more than a decade, Apple has been pulling off its favorite trick at the autumn presentation
                      shows actually last year's iPhone, but in a new color and with minor improvements. One of the most
                      cool trump cards of the Cupertino developers is the former autonomy of the new iPhone with reduced
                      battery capacity. However, this cannot continue indefinitely, since the time of work cannot be seriously
                      increase only due to the energy efficiency of the processor, and Android smartphones with their 5000 mAh batteries
                      can already work longer than the Pro Max version. Apple decided to take a serious step, but buyers
                      have to put up with the inconvenience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     According to the data leaked to the Web, the battery capacity of the iPhone 15 will increase significantly. But get closer
                      only two models will succeed in Android smartphones, among which there will be no iPhone 15 Pro.
                  </p>
                  <h3>iPhone with the most powerful battery</h3>
                  <p>
                     The closer the autumn presentation of Apple, the more rumors about
                      news leaks to the web. It always happens in a planned way, and
                      the data is almost always correct. The leak was
                      discovered by 9to5mac on the ITHome website, where close to
                      Foxconn source talks about the iPhone 15 battery. Here's how it works
                      will increase compared to last year's model range.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>iPhone 15: 3877 mAh (3279 mAh)</li>
                     <li>iPhone 15 Plus: 4912 mAh (4325  mAh)</li>
                     <li>iPhone 15 Pro: 3650 mAh (3200 mAh)</li>
                     <li>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 4852 mAh (4323  mAh)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                     As you can see, we are expecting a really serious increase in capacity.
                      Much, of course, depends on the energy efficiency of the processor, but
                      Apple has never had a problem with this. Here's what's out of it
                      follows.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        The largest increase in capacity will affect the base iPhone 15 - almost
                         18%. For comparison, in previous versions it varied in
                         within 9%.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        iPhone 15 Plus is only the second generation of a smartphone, but the capacity
                         its battery life will increase by almost 14%. This figure is again
                         higher than the Pro Max version, and it will also come close to
                         iPad mini 6 battery (5124 mAh).
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        The iPhone 15 Pro battery is again the weakest in the line, though
                         capacity and will increase by 14%. This is due to small
                         body dimensions and a large camera unit, which in this
                         year, according to rumors, will be replenished with a periscope.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        The iPhone 15 Pro Max battery will grow by almost 11%
                         relative to the previous model and is still slightly inferior
                         Plus versions. However, autonomy will be higher due to the new
                         3nm A17 Bionic.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                     Interestingly, Apple does not advertise the battery capacity of iPhones even
                      on their website, for example, as in the case of the iPhone 14 Plus, which
                      at the presentation dubbed "the longest-playing smartphone" -
                      have to wait for iFixit parsing to make sure
                      indicators. At the same time, Android smartphone manufacturers
                      always emphasize this, often lowering the capacitance to
                      "Typical" 5000 mAh, although sometimes it is 5 percent higher.
                  </p>

                  <h3>What the iPhone 15 will look like</h3>
                  <p>
                     Earlier we already wrote about the external changes of the iPhone 15 models: these are
                     and an enlarged screen with thin bezels, and a new key
                     volume controls, as well as an updated camera unit. New
                     The iPhone will receive not only an improved battery, but also an increased
                     the minimum amount of storage - now it will be 256 GB, however,
                     only in Pro-versions of smartphones.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Apparently, Apple thought that 128 GB in the iPhone 15 Pro is too much
                      few in our time, although the previous storage upgrade was only 2
                      years ago and immediately for all models. Now the amount of memory is
                      one difference between regular iPhone and Pro. True, this time
                      prices will not remain the same - Tim Cook has already let slip that
                      smart phones will become more expensive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     For now, the base iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro have
                      thickness of 7.85 mm, but if the firmware increase in size is associated with
                      camera update, then other models have visible reasons for this
                      No. In general, the smartphone industry has taken a wrong turn: for
                      comparison, the thickness of the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is already 8.9 mm, and
                      shockproof IIF150 Air1 Ultra - 9.55 mm!
