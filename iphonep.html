                              if you don't want to regret it! Buy iPhone 14 while you can</h3>
                           <p>Two months left before the iPhone 15 presentation, but people have already begun to wonder
                              traditional
                              question that arises for everyone on the eve of the release of a new model: is it
                              Should I wait for a new iPhone or is it better to buy an iPhone 14 right now? Give
                              it is impossible to answer it unambiguously, since everything is not so simple here,
                              as you might think. However, we have delved into this topic so
                              as deep as possible to see if it makes sense
                              endure a few months when you can now buy an excellent smartphone and
                              use it without any inconvenience.</p>

                           <p>This year marks 6 years since the release of the iPhone X: at the moment,
                              this is the latest smartphone from Apple, which has had major changes - not without reason it is called
                              revolutionary. Since then, however, Apple has made only minor improvements, exploiting
                              All
                              the same form factor. There will be changes: judging by the leaks from insiders, the iPhone 15 will receive
                              some cool chips that have been asking for a long time. They will make you buy
                              model
                              2023, not last year. We tell you what's new in the iPhone 15 and how it will be better
                              last year's models.</p>

                        <h3>The new iPhone will get a powerful battery and twice as much memory, but will become more expensive</h3>
                        <p>For more than a decade, Apple has been pulling off its favorite trick at the autumn presentation
                           shows actually last year's iPhone, but in a new color and with minor improvements. One of
                           of the coolest trump cards of the Cupertino developers is the former autonomy of the new iPhone with
                           reduced battery capacity. However, this cannot continue indefinitely, since time
                           work cannot be seriously increased only due to the energy efficiency of the processor, and
                           Android smartphones with their 5000 mAh batteries can already last longer than the Pro Max version. Apple
                           decided on a serious step, but buyers will have to put up with the inconvenience. </p>

                        <h3>Apple is cheating us again! USB-C in the iPhone 15 will be a surprise</h3>
                        <p>USB Type-C for different categories of devices has already become the standard. It is thanks to him that you can
                           take different chargers for your smartphone, tablet and laptop with you on trips, and get by
                           one and transmit data over the wire at high speeds. But the only smartphones that
                           iPhones have not yet switched to USB-C. However, this will not last long. To fulfill
                           legal requirements in Europe, Apple will have to transfer its smartphones to the new connector.</p>
